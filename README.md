Info 2201 Final Project

# Project Overview
For this project, I analyzed the 4 front runners from the 2023-2024 season MVP race regular season performance and compared their regular season performances, which put them in the conversation for MVP in the first place. I wanted to see how much their play fluctuated during the season and how well their play impacted their team as well as how well their play made a case for them to win the MVP.
I used Moneypuck (https://moneypuck.com/index.html) a source that utilizes more than surface statistics, I looked into statistics crossing all situations (5v5, 5v4, 4v5, etc): 'season', 'name', 'team', 'position', 'situation', 'games_played', 'icetime', 'shifts', 'OnIce_F_goals', 'OnIce_F_shotAttempts', 'penalityMinutesDrawn', 'I_F_shifts', 'onIce_corsiPercentage', 'offIce_corsiPercentage', 'onIce_fenwickPercentage', 'offIce_fenwickPercentage','I_F_primaryAssists', 'I_F_secondaryAssists', 'I_F_points', 'I_F_goals', 'I_F_hits', 'I_F_mediumDangerShots', 'I_F_highDangerShots', 'I_F_mediumDangerGoals', 'I_F_highDangerGoals', 'I_F_oZoneShiftStarts', 'I_F_dZoneShiftStarts', and 'I_F_neutralZoneShiftStarts'.
With Moneypuck's wealth of data, I could get a good look into each MVP finalist that played in the 2023-2024 season and their relative statistics. 

# Data Source
For this project, I gathered my data from Moneypuck, primarily the Data page, where I found skater data for the 2023-2024 season. The Moneypuck Data Page.(https://moneypuck.com/data.htm)

The data is in CSV format, available with the 2023-2024 regular season statistics for all skaters that saw ice time. The CSV provides me with statistics ranging from Games played to adjusted and expected statistics such as expected goals and expected shots on goal. 

Pros: Easy access and publicly available to all. Updated with data from every season for every player, every team, and every metric. 

Cons: Less historical data, the data only dates back to the 2008-2009 season. Potentially an overload of data and metrics depending on the case and the usage.
