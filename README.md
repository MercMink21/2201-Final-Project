Info 2201 Final Project

# Project Overview
For this project, I am analyzing Nathan Mackinnon's regular-season performance versus his post-season performance. I wanted to see how much Mackinnon's play changed when it mattered most, in the playoffs. Using Hockey Reference, I looked into 5 statistics, Points, Plus/Minus, Shooting Percentage, Average Time On Ice, and Faceoff Win Percentage. With Hockey Reference's wealth of data, I could get a good look into each year of Mackinnon's, both regular season and post-season.
