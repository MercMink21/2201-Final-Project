Info 2201 Final Project

# Project Overview
For this project, I am analyzing NHL Goalies from the 2023-2024 season that made the postseason, and comparing their regular season performances, which got them to the postseason. I wanted to see how much their play fluctuated during the season and if their play in the regular season justified a playoff birth for them, and their team. Using Moneypuck (https://moneypuck.com/index.html) a source that utilizes more than surface statistics, I looked into 5 statistics all in 5v5 situations, High Danger Shots, High Danger Goals, Goals, Shots On Goal, and Ice time. With Moneypucks wealth of data, I could get a good look into each Goalie that played in the 2023-2024 season and their relative statistics. 

# Data Source
For this project, I gathered my data from Moneypuck, primarily the Data page, where I found Goalie data for the 2023-2024 season. The Moneypuck Data Page.(https://moneypuck.com/data.htm)

The data is in CSV format, available with the 2023-2024 regular season statistics for relevant Goalies. The CSV provides me with statistics ranging from Games played to adjusted and expected statistics such as expected plays stopped and expected shots on goal the goalie would face.
